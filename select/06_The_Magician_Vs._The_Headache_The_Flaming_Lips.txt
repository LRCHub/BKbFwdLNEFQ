Sermon's over, but can you feel it now on the ground
No, it never takes you very long, no, it never takes you very long

Sometimes I come home and there's a monkey
He's puttin' down, he's makin' love to the hole in my head
He's makin' love to the hole in my head

Sermon's over, but can you feel it now on the ground
No, it never takes you very long, no, it never takes you very long
No, it never takes you very long, no, it never takes you very long
No, it never takes you very long

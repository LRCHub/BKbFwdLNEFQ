You know why
They called and just let it ring
No reply
The door was open, I swear
Ain't no use in pickin' up
You know why

It's all my head, I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Until my headache goes

Taste so good
Oh well, I knew it would
Taste so good
Burn like a match house
Medicate just to make you soft
Love is blind

Can't you release me?
What the hell were they thinking of?
You know why

It's all my head, I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Until my headache goes

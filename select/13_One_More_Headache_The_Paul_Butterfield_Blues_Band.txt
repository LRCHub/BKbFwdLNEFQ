One more heartache baby
I can't take it now
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like a camel
With a heavy pack, yeah
One last straw, they say
Broke the camel's back

Oh babe, whoa
I can't take it babe
I can't stand it now

One more heartache
It would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high
Then you let me down
Like a house that's built of toothpicks
Stacked upon a kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down
The foundation was not able

Oh babe, whoa
I can't take it babe
I can't stand it now, whoa

One more heartache

One more heartache babe
I can't take it now
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like a camel
With a heavy pack, yeah
One last straw, they say
Broke the camel's back

Oh baby, whoa
I can't take it babe
I can't stand it now

One more
Heartache babe
One more, now
Heartache babe
Without your love
Without your love, baby
I can't stand it no longer
Ow baby, woo-hoo
Come on, won't you listen
To my plea
Oh please, baby
Oh please, baby

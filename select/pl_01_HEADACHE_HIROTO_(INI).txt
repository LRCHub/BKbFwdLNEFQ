Tell me all the things you're hiding from me
baby
I don't know why but can't stop thinking about
you every day
Somebody get the meds, feelin' like I'm dead Woo
Knockin' on my head
Knockin' on my head
Uh
Got me feeling like a WA!!
HEADACHE HEADACHE
You got me feeling like a
HEADACHE HEADACHE
You got me feeling like a
Stuck in my head like a loopin' beat
The way you move your lip, movin' in slo mo
Red and pink 染まる唇惑わす she got me goin loco
Like your hair style Woo
Like your make up Woo
Let me see your OOTD
Girl you making me go crazy
Up and down like a seesaw
繰り返すまた Recall
Heart beating like ding ding dong
Wanna let you know
You're my indigo
Take me to your room, caught in your perfume
Just love me how you do love me how you do
Fading like an echo
届かない Like rainbow
Reaching out, but pain grows
抜け出せない Same flow
頭ん中にこべりついてる Old screen
144p
Can't make it clean
You're making me freeze in every scene
Uh
Got me feeling like a WA!!
HEADACHE HEADACHE
You got me feeling like a
HEADACHE HEADACHE
You got me feeling like a
朝昼晩あっという間に
過ぎてく Time but I still can't see
You're my only drug, I need no plan B
But you're my only drug that's killing me
Oh my oh my oh my oh my oh
You got me losing all my control
なのに欲しがるもっと
逆らえないこの衝動
Let me hold on
Let me hold on
Let me hold on
Sometimes I go so wrong but I go on
On…
Can't stop thinking about you yeah
Sometimes I go so wrong but I go on
HEADACHE HEADACHE
WA!!
HEADACHE HEADACHE
Uh
Got me feeling like a WA!!
HEADACHE HEADACHE
You got me feeling like a
HEADACHE HEADACHE
Uh
Got me feeling like a WA!!
